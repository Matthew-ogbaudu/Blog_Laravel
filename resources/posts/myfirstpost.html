        Nature,in the broadest sense,is the natural world,physical universe,
        material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to
        the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
        Manufactured objects and human interaction are, in common usage, not
        considered part of nature unless qualified in ways such as "human nature"
        or "the whole of nature". Nature is generally distinguished from the supernatural.
        It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the galactic.
