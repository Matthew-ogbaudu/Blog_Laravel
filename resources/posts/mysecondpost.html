    <h1>My Second Post</h1>
    Earth(or,"the earth")the fifth largest planet in the solar system,third in order of distance from the Sun.
    It is the largest of its planetary system's terrestrial planets and the only place in
     the universe known to support life.
    The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar regions,
    two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.
    Precipitation patterns vary widely according to location, ranging from several metres of water per year
    to less than a millimetre. About 70 percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans.
    The remainder consists of continents and islands, with the vast majority of the inhabited
    land in the Northern Hemisphere.
