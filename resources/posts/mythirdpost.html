    <h1>My Third Post</h1>
    Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally
    accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization,
     metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said
     to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.
